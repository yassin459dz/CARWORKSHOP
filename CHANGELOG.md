## [Unreleased]

### Features
- Initial setup of the project structure using Laravel and Livewire. _(2025-06-11)_
- Added pagination to the client list view for improved navigation and performance when displaying multiple clients. _(2025-06-11)_

### Enhancements
- Improved documentation and changelog structure for easier tracking of project evolution. _(2025-06-11)_

### Bug Fixes
- **Livewire Client Component BindingResolutionException**: Diagnosed and resolved an error where the Livewire Client component was incorrectly suspected to require a `$data` constructor argument. Confirmed that the component is properly set up to receive data via a listener (`setClient`) and not via constructor or mount. Verified no misuses of `@livewire('client', ['data' => ...])` or `Livewire::mount('client', ...)` exist in the codebase. Noted that persistent errors may be due to cached/old compiled views or non-obvious includes. _(2025-06-11)_

### Technical Decisions & Architecture
- **Livewire Data Handling**: Data for the Client component is passed via a listener (`setClient`) instead of constructor or mount, ensuring compatibility with Laravel/Livewire best practices. _(2025-06-11)_
- **Payment Modal Logic**: Payment modal display is determined by client sold values:
  - If client has Debt (sold < 0): Always open payment modal.
  - If client has Credit (sold > 0): Always open payment modal.
  - If client is Settled (sold = 0): Open modal only if "Client will make partial/full payment now" checkbox is checked.
  - Otherwise: Submit order directly without opening payment modal. _(2025-06-11)_
- UI displays an indicator showing client sold status (Debt/Credit/Settled) with color coding. The `validateOrder()` function logic matches this indicator. _(2025-06-11)_

### Known Issues
- Persistent Livewire errors may be caused by cached/old compiled views or hidden includes. Clear caches and recompile views if unexplained errors persist.
